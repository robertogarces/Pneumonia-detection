# Pneumonia-detection

Hello! In this repository you will find a CNN-based model that predicts if a chest X-ray presents or not pneumonia, and if it presents this disease, the model will tell if this is a virus or bacterial one.

The model is in a jupyter notebook. There you will find all my annotations in each step. I hope you enjoy and learn from this notebook. If you find how to improve this model I will be enourmesly appretiated if you share it with me. Also, any comments you can write me to rgarcesfe@gmail.com

I didn't uploaded the original images, but the resized ones because the original are too heavy (~2gb). The original images were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.
